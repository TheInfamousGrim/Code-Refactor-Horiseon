# Code-Refactor-Horiseon

## Description of Task

The task is to **refactor** and edit the code so that it is more **semantic**, make sure that code is functioning correctly and most importantly ensure that the site is **accessible** as possible.

### User Story

_AS A marketing agency_
_I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards_
_SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines_

In detail I have to ensure all the links are working correctly, that the CSS is consolidated by selectors and properties so that they follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements on the index.html document.
Finally I need to add comments where necessary ensuring that the code is understandable to others who would need to edit and update it as necessary.

What did I learn? (to be completed after the task has been completed)
