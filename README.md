# Code-Refactor-Horiseon

## Description of Task

The task is to **refactor** and edit the code so that it is more **semantic**, make sure that code is functioning correctly and most importantly ensure that the site is **accessible** as possible.

### User Story

_AS A marketing agency_

_I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards_

_SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines_

In detail I have to ensure all the links are working correctly, that the CSS is consolidated by selectors and properties so that they follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements on the index.html document.
Finally I need to add comments where necessary ensuring that the code is understandable to others who would need to edit and update it as necessary.

### What did I learn?

- The alt attributes aren't only important for screen readers but they also help to optimise
- If you want to add alt text to a background image that is placed using CSS you need to use and aria label attribute on the div or on a child span if that's not possible
- It is important to group selectors when styling elements in the exact same way as it makes your CSS more concise.
- Your CSS should always make semantic sense when compared to your HTML files as that will make your code more readable and editable
- Commenting is super important for code legibility
- README files should be well structured and have all relevant links in working order
- The correct licensing should be used for your code where possible so that others no what rights they have if they wish to edit your code
- badges/shields help to show that you know what your doing with regards to development. They're not necessary but can be important
- I learned how to get a site live with GitHub pages
